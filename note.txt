1️⃣ MVC architecture

Model: Business Logic
    - Solves the business problem
    - Directly related to business rules, how the business works, and business needs
    - Ex:
        - Creating new tours in the database
        - Check if user's password is correct
        - Ensuring only users who bought a tour can review it

Controller: Application Logic
    - Concerned about managing requests and responses
    - More technical aspects
    - Bridge between model and view layers

View: Presentation Logic

👉🏻 👉🏻 👉🏻 Fat models/thin controllers: offload as much logic as possible into the models, and keep the controllers as simple and lean as possible
